# Segmentation Editor: SegEditor

![SegEditor](etc/help/segeditor.png)

A Graphical-User Interface (GUI) for editing segmentation maps for IDL.

## Getting Started

Download the directories and put the src/ dir in the User's IDL_PATH environment variable.  The code is started by:

```
IDL> segeditor,SEGFILE,IMGFILE,[/help,_EXTRA=_extra]
```

where SEGFILE and IMGFILE are the full paths to a segmentation image and its corresponding direct image.  The /help flag will display a basic calling sequence, and _extra facilitates additional keyword arguments.


Once the GUI is loaded, there is a button for help (indicated by ![help](etc/bitmaps/help.bmp)), which will explain the various functionality.  But one also refer to the astro-ph article for more details and/or to reference (if you find this code was useful in preparing your data or manuscript [(Ryan 2018)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180804378R).

## To Do Ideas:
1. Add new segmap button.
